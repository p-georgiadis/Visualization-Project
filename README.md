# Visualization-Project

## Overview
This project is part of the course **"Fundamentals of Data Visualization"** offered by the **University of Colorado Boulder**. The course explores the design, development, and evaluation of information visualizations, combining aspects of design, computer graphics, HCI, and data science. This project involves working with the Titanic dataset to perform exploratory data analysis and create insightful visualizations.

### About the Course
**Course:** Fundamentals of Data Visualization  
**Institution:** University of Colorado Boulder  
**Instructor:** Danielle Szafir, Assistant Professor, ATLAS Institute and Computer Science

**Course Description:**
Data is everywhere. Charts, graphs, and other types of information visualizations help people to make sense of this data. This course explores the design, development, and evaluation of such information visualizations. By combining aspects of design, computer graphics, HCI, and data science, you will gain hands-on experience with creating visualizations, using exploratory tools, and architecting data narratives. Topics include user-centered design, web-based visualization, data cognition and perception, and design evaluation.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following files and directories:

- `Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset.
- `titanic.csv`: The Titanic dataset used for analysis and visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the Jupyter notebook.
- `project_documents/`: Directory containing various markdown files documenting different aspects of the project:
  - `Discussion_of_the_dataset.md`
  - `Sketching_your_Data.md`
  - `Preliminary_Evaluation_Plan_for_Dataset_Visualization.md`

## Getting Started
To get the notebooks up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Visualization-Project.git
    cd Visualization-Project
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

6. Open the `Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to see the exploratory data analysis and visualizations.

## Project Documents
The `project_documents` directory contains detailed documentation about different aspects of the project. You can navigate through the documents by visiting the [Project Documents Index](project_documents/index.md).

- **Discussion_of_the_dataset.md**: Discusses the source of the data, key attributes, and goals for working with the data.
- **Sketching_your_data.md**: Contains sketches and preliminary design ideas for visualizing the data.
- **Preliminary_evaluation_plan.md**: Outlines a plan for evaluating the effectiveness of the visualizations.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. You can find the dataset at [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file/data).
