### Preliminary Evaluation Plan for Titanic Dataset Visualization

#### Target Question
The main question I want to answer with my visualizations is: "What factors most significantly influenced the survival rates of passengers on the Titanic?"

#### Participants
To evaluate the effectiveness of the visualization in answering this question, I would recruit:
1. **Data Analysts**: To assess the technical accuracy and depth of insights.
2. **Historians or Sociologists**: To provide contextual understanding and verify the historical relevance of the insights.
3. **General Audience**: To ensure the visualization is understandable and informative to non-experts.

#### Measures
1. **Insight Depth**: The extent to which the visualization helps participants uncover new and significant information about survival factors.
   - **Measure**: Number of unique insights identified by participants.
   - **What it tells us**: Higher number of unique insights indicates a deeper understanding facilitated by the visualization.

2. **Use Cases**: Practical applications of the visualization in real-world scenarios.
   - **Measure**: Number and variety of suggested use cases by participants.
   - **What it tells us**: Diverse use cases indicate versatility and practicality of the visualization.

3. **Accuracy**: The correctness of the information derived from the visualization.
   - **Measure**: Comparison of insights with known historical data and statistical analyses.
   - **What it tells us**: High accuracy indicates reliability of the visualization.

4. **Engagement**: The level of participant interaction and interest.
   - **Measure**: Time spent interacting with the visualization and participant feedback.
   - **What it tells us**: Higher engagement suggests the visualization is compelling and user-friendly.

#### Approach
**Mixed-Methods Approach**:
1. **Journaling Study**: Participants would use the visualization over a set period, noting down their insights, questions, and interactions.
2. **Formal Experiment**: Structured tasks where participants answer specific questions using the visualization, followed by a survey.

#### Instantiation
1. **Journaling Study**:
   - Participants would be given access to the visualization tool.
   - Over a week, they would document their insights, how they navigated the visualization, and any questions that arose.
   - Weekly check-ins to discuss their findings and provide feedback.

2. **Formal Experiment**:
   - Participants would be given a series of questions/tasks to complete using the visualization.
   - Post-task survey to gather feedback on the ease of use, clarity, and perceived usefulness of the visualization.
   - Compare the accuracy and depth of insights from participants' answers.

#### Success Criteria
1. **High Insight Depth**: Participants uncover multiple significant insights about survival factors.
2. **Broad Use Cases**: Participants suggest diverse and practical applications for the visualization.
3. **High Accuracy**: Insights derived from the visualization match known historical data and statistical analyses.
4. **Strong Engagement**: Participants spend significant time interacting with the visualization and provide positive feedback.

By evaluating the visualization using these criteria, I aim to ensure that it is not only informative and accurate but also engaging and practical for a wide range of users.
